I need a simple react.js script with the following requirements. I already have most of the script done, I just need it completed. Refer to the attached file react.js-script.txt for the script.

The main nav bar should have the following links:

Add timer

manage timers

Create a 'manage timers' link. When click on 'manage timers' link it will go to a page that displays all added timers with an 'edit' and 'delete' buttons.

If I click on edit, it will go to the page to edit the timer's fields.
